I&#39;d like to develop open source hardware and software relating to that magical intersection space. Specifically, I&#39;m interested in the design and final result. I&#39;m looking forward to developing the user experience, with an intuitive interface, graphic design, animations, and robust tracking algorithms. I&#39;m also looking forward to playing with this project in a usable state.</p>\n<p>I would like to learn answers to new questions revealed through experimentation and research through development. I intend for my learning to be driven by trying new things and figuring out what works and what doesn&#39;t. I anticipate that I will run into questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How low can I reduce the cost while still providing a first-class experience?</li>\n<li>What type of pico-projector should I use?<ul>\n<li>Will the screen resolution be sufficient?</li>\n<li>Can it be powered through USB?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What kind of tracking system should I use to track multiple styluses and fingers?<ul>\n<li>How fast and accurate can this tracking be?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Will a smartphone be powerful enough to provide computation to the platform?<ul>\n<li>How will multiple devices be supported?</li>\n<li>How power efficient will it be?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As research, I can try/develop different algorithms, test different hardware configurations, conduct user testing, and perhaps perform field testing in a classroom environment. In this case, research will be less of learning existing knowledge than experimentation and answering new questions. At the end, I would like to have developed a low-cost, cloud-connected, mobile computation platform targeted at education and use in the classroom. I&#39;m aiming towards less of a sellable product and more of an open-source documented process that anyone who is interested enough can follow and create one for themselves.</p>\n<p>In terms of formal interviewing, I can contact software and hardware engineers, user experience/Human Computer Interaction designers, school administration, or someone at the Concord Consortium - an organization about digital resources for education. Informally, I can interview various teachers, students, or even  people off the street.</p>\n<p>Definitely, the web will be a big resource in finding existing projects and learning from others/existing code resources. Print tends to be out of date for such a recent topic, unless the prints are recently published papers. More specifically, user testing in the form of informal interviews or question/answer sessions will be critical to rapid iteration, determining new features, as well as gauging the size and potential adoptance of the user base.</p>\n";"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define([],function(){return o}):"object"==typeof n&&n&&n.exports&&(n.exports=o)}),require.register("content/topic-exploration",function(e,t,n){var o='<p>Ever since the mid-to end of my junior year, I have had ideas for Senior project in mind. I began by considering the two largest aspects of my life - education and technology - and the space in which they collide. The initial direction I had in mind was to hybridize a brick-and-mortar classroom with an online classroom by bringing technology into the classroom. My thoughts reached out to digital pens, surface computing, and online tools. However, I found myself returning to an overarching goal; In order for technology to truly be ubiquitous in the classroom, it has to has to be discrete/unobtrusive, intuitive, easily integratable, and most importantly, low-cost. A few months ago, I discussed my senior project ideas very briefly with the CEO of an organization I interned for in the past two summers.  This non-profit organization, the Concord Consortium, develops software to be used in the classroom. I have looked around in the field, though there does not appear to be many existing projects whose aims align with mine. Since then, I have settle down on a topic involving pico-projectors and 3D sensing. More completely, my project is to create a low-cost, networked, interactive computing platform designed for schools and per-student use.</p>\n<p>I would like my senior year to be a time in which I can invest larger portions of my time to get returns much larger than I had ever before. I&#39;ve reached a point in which I can think up ideas that require much larger portions of time to reasonably achieve. Of course, I would not want my college applications to be jeopardized by my investing, so I most of my project work will take place after the new year. As always, I would like to continue to grow my programming and math skills.</p>\n<p>Recently, thinking about educational technologies has opened my eyes to the new articles in newspapers and magazines every week. In the past week alone, I picked up two articles from the Wall Street Journal and TIME Magazine about technology in the classroom, which were both very relevant to my project as well as society today.;</p>\n<p><img src="topic-exploration/TIME.jpg" alt="">\n<img src="topic-exploration/Wall Street.jpg" alt="">\n<img src="topic-exploration/Wall Street Detail.jpg" alt=""></p>\n<p><em>From left to right, TIME Magazine, Wall Street Journal, and a close-up of Wall Street Journal</em></p>\n<p>Although I can find plenty of sources detailing the current state of classrooms, I am not sure how much information I can find about future technologies. After all, the future is yet to be made, and I hope my senior project can double as a research project to test out new ideas and rapidly iterate upon what works and what doesn&#39;t. At least, I can interview the CEO of the Concord Consortium to gain insight on his vision of how education and technology will mesh for the next generation.</p>\n<p>Frankly, I have no current concerns about my senior project. As I see my project as a research opportunity, I will be able to collect bountiful feedback from teachers and students alike, even if the project flops and ends up unusable. As with any invention or creative endeavor, there is hardly a downside - the worst that can happen is to learn from my mistakes. I believe this project has potential - a reason that I&#39;m utterly stoked and passionate about it. As the information age of the 21st century spreads out to smartphones and social websites, it has yet to touch the education system that has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years. As technology has revolutionized the way we work, play, and communictae with others, it is destined to improve education - and that change starts <em>today</em>.</p>\n';"function"==typeof define&&define.amd?define([],function(){return o}):"object"==typeof n&&n&&n.exports&&(n.exports=o)}),require.register("main",function(e,t){var n,o=t("content");for(i=0;i<o.length;i++)n=o[i],n.content=t("content/"+n.id);document.getElementById("post-list").content=o});
