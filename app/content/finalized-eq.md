*I'm On Track!*

Although I have not made much progress towards development of my project, I have done more thinking towards the direction of my EQ. As such, I've revised my EQ as follows:

> How can I develop a low-cost, digital upgrade to the pencil-and-paper experience?

My previous EQ was alltogether too broad, and the creation a generalized educational device had a scope beyond what I could accomplish. I realized that the core part of such a device used in the classroom would be note taking. More specifically, if a device could bridge the gap between [paper and pixel](http://paperxpixel.tumblr.com/), it could be the printing-press (pun intended) of the information age, making technology widspread and commonplace inside the classroom. After all, most of traditional education is based in paper, so an upgrade to paper would upgrade students everywhere. But before I continue, I should ask:

How can paper be upgraded, anyways?

Perhaps it's the entire writing experience that could use an overhaul?

What is the act of writing anyways, and why do we write in the classroom?

Well, I'll start off simple and build up, answering these questions in reverse order. Speaking from personal experience as a student, taking notes in the classroom helps to capture the ideas, conveyed by the teacher, that form in my head. When I'm tired, note taking takes on its simplest form - acknowledging that I have read the whiteboard by copying it down. After all, some part of my brain needs pass that information as I do so. At its best, my notes include interdisciplinary connections between my classes and conceptually-reinforcing corollaries I derive in real-time, to name a few.

As such, the note writing experience needs to be expressive, open, and fluid. I should be able to translate my thoughts into a condensed, storable, physical form that I, or others, can return to and reconstruct with minimal ambiguity. The process of note taking should be a seamless, flawless, and responsive exchange -- a dance, if you will, between writer and paper, mind and matter. While long-haul note taking, I find myself in a zone of concentration, zen, and pure information flow.

Which leads me to the first question - how can the next generation of paper aid this process? Or should I ask - how can matter enhance the mind's ability to store and retrieve information? This question borders on the edge of metaphysics, psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and many more fields of study. It at least could be designed with the brain in mind (no pun intended), taking into account how the brain itself stores and retrieves memories.

Starting off simple from what I've recently read and learned in psychology, the brain stores information in a fragmented manner. This mandates a powerful search for memory retrieval. Perhaps a note system would work similarly - notes would be taken on a whim and stored in a free-flowing, fragmented manner. The storage would be backed by a powerful context-based search that could search via handwriting, time, or place.

Through answering my EQ, the near goal is to develop a note taking software that's built around maximizing information storage and retrieval. The next step would be to develop specialized note taking hardware, by pairing a stylus sensing technology with a pico-projection system to create my product. Both steps would involve planning, from all aspects of hardware and software.

In conclusion, I have been narrowing my vision and refining the path I would like to take before I fully commit my time and energy. I'm proud of the vision that I have refined so far, though I'm worried that the product may not come to fruition. I can hope to improve my planning so that I can achieve my final result, which will be the most exciting part of all.
