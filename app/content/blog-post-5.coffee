At the moment, I've gotten about 17 gigabytes of combined footage and audio. Not bad!\n\n![](blog-post-5/Capture.png)\n\nI'll just need enough time to edit and combine the best parts of all this data...",

Interaction : present : product - when I show my completed video, prefaced with some words about filming, editing, and interaction.\n3. Education : future : vision - when I share my vision about how interaction and storytelling are core to the future of education.\n\nIn addition, I've designed some symbols to outline and reflect each section.\n\n![](blog-post-5/Banner.png)\n\nI might draft some flyers/posters with this new branding to raise awareness of my presentation and post them around the school, but that's if I get around studying for Economics APs.",

I did not anticipate for it to run this late, about a week past schedule, but I did start a bit late because I didn't find a microphone in time. I know that editing will also take a long time, but hopefully I can pull it off in time.\n\nAlso, I realized that perhaps I could swap around the topics that I had Mariah and Mark speak about, but I don't nearly have enough time to do that. I'm pretty sure that it'll turn out somewhat nicely regardless, if I'm able to edit it well.\n\nLooking back, weekly progress updates can get tiresome after a while... documenting the process is certainly a lot of work, but it's definitely worth it to look back at everything in the end.\n\nThat's it for now. I'll be off editing, planning, and designing my presentation. You'll hear the entire story then.",
