Ever since the mid-to end of my junior year, I have had ideas for Senior project in mind. I began by considering the two largest aspects of my life - education and technology - and the space in which they collide. The initial direction I had in mind was to hybridize a brick-and-mortar classroom with an online classroom by bringing technology into the classroom. My thoughts reached out to digital pens, surface computing, and online tools. However, I found myself returning to an overarching goal; In order for technology to truly be ubiquitous in the classroom, it has to has to be discrete/unobtrusive, intuitive, easily integratable, and most importantly, low-cost. A few months ago, I discussed my senior project ideas very briefly with the CEO of an organization I interned for in the past two summers.  This non-profit organization, the Concord Consortium, develops software to be used in the classroom. I have looked around in the field, though there does not appear to be many existing projects whose aims align with mine. Since then, I have settle down on a topic involving pico-projectors and 3D sensing. More completely, my project is to create a low-cost, networked, interactive computing platform designed for schools and per-student use.

I would like my senior year to be a time in which I can invest larger portions of my time to get returns much larger than I had ever before. I've reached a point in which I can think up ideas that require much larger portions of time to reasonably achieve. Of course, I would not want my college applications to be jeopardized by my investing, so I most of my project work will take place after the new year. As always, I would like to continue to grow my programming and math skills.

Recently, thinking about educational technologies has opened my eyes to the new articles in newspapers and magazines every week. In the past week alone, I picked up two articles from the Wall Street Journal and TIME Magazine about technology in the classroom, which were both very relevant to my project as well as society today.;

Although I can find plenty of sources detailing the current state of classrooms, I am not sure how much information I can find about future technologies. After all, the future is yet to be made, and I hope my senior project can double as a research project to test out new ideas and rapidly iterate upon what works and what doesn't. At least, I can interview the CEO of the Concord Consortium to gain insight on his vision of how education and technology will mesh for the next generation.

Frankly, I have no current concerns about my senior project. As I see my project as a research opportunity, I will be able to collect bountiful feedback from teachers and students alike, even if the project flops and ends up unusable. As with any invention or creative endeavor, there is hardly a downside - the worst that can happen is to learn from my mistakes. I believe this project has potential - a reason that I'm utterly stoked and passionate about it. As the information age of the 21st century spreads out to smartphones and social websites, it has yet to touch the education system that has remained virtually unchanged for hundreds of years. As technology has revolutionized the way we work, play, and communictae with others, it is destined to improve education - and that change starts *today*.
