Generally, my topic is the space where Education and Technology meet. I'd like to develop open source hardware and software relating to that magical intersection space. Specifically, I'm interested in the design and final result. I'm looking forward to developing the user experience, with an intuitive interface, graphic design, animations, and robust tracking algorithms. I'm also looking forward to playing with this project in a usable state.

I would like to learn answers to new questions revealed through experimentation and research through development. I intend for my learning to be driven by trying new things and figuring out what works and what doesn't. I anticipate that I will run into questions such as:

- How low can I reduce the cost while still providing a first-class experience?
- What type of pico-projector should I use?
  - Will the screen resolution be sufficient?
  - Can it be powered through USB?
- What kind of tracking system should I use to track multiple styluses and fingers?
  - How fast and accurate can this tracking be?
- Will a smartphone be powerful enough to provide computation to the platform?
  - How will multiple devices be supported?
  - How power efficient will it be?

As research, I can try/develop different algorithms, test different hardware configurations, conduct user testing, and perhaps perform field testing in a classroom environment. In this case, research will be less of learning existing knowledge than experimentation and answering new questions. At the end, I would like to have developed a low-cost, cloud-connected, mobile computation platform targeted at education and use in the classroom. I'm aiming towards less of a sellable product and more of an open-source documented process that anyone who is interested enough can follow and create one for themselves.

In terms of formal interviewing, I can contact software and hardware engineers, user experience/Human Computer Interaction designers, school administration, or someone at the Concord Consortium - an organization about digital resources for education. Informally, I can interview various teachers, students, or even  people off the street.

Definitely, the web will be a big resource in finding existing projects and learning from others/existing code resources. Print tends to be out of date for such a recent topic, unless the prints are recently published papers. More specifically, user testing in the form of informal interviews or question/answer sessions will be critical to rapid iteration, determining new features, as well as gauging the size and potential adoptance of the user base.
