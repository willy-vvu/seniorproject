Therefore, this post is going to be relatively short.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I've been down to script finalizing and filming. I met with the librarian, and she helped me trim down the flow and questions I'll ask while interviewing people for the video.\n\nI plan to have the video be constructed from various interviews. The questions I ask will not be included, but rather the responses spoken. The questions are structured to elicit certain responses that are self-contained.",

How did you overcome them?",

Two of these were done at the school during free periods.\n\nI used the standard setup that I described in [blog post #2](#blog-post-2), which worked quite well! The quality has actually come out much better than I expected.",

      "content": "During the process, I've encountered some minor camera issues, such as running out of battery, running out of space, and reaching the maximum video length in one take. Thankfully, none of these issues interrupted the middle of an interview or caused data loss.\n\nOverall, I've collected about 6.3 gigabytes of HD footage and audio over the past week. The memory card only stores 4 gigabytes, so I needed to offload the data onto my computer. I've also been trying to keep all the content organized, as I might get a lot of it in the end! You can see a screenshot of my file system:\n\n![](blog-post-4/Capture.png)",

      "content": "I'll be interviewing Mrs. Fishkin next week, because we were short on time and planning. Planning is definitely something to work on going forward. It might be beneficial now that she has \"rehearsed\" her lines!\n\nAlso, I'll see what I can do regarding tweaking the questions to elicit a concise and clear answer. Sometimes the questions are not as clear as the intention behind them, and the intention can be important than the the question.\n\nI've also realized that editing is everything. Regardless of response order, number of times said, or mistakes made, it's up to the editing process to get the best parts of everything in one place. I'm glad that I started early so that I would have enough time to comb through all that I've gathered.\n\nI'll be shooting more interviews and perhaps a mock classroom next week. See you then!\n\nP.S. This blog post is structured quite similarly to what I plan the final video to be! Each choice will be a \"learn more\" or \"learn about (new topic)\" choice designed to conditionally show extra content. I've thought about this previously in [blog post #2](#blog-post-2).",
