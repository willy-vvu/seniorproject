I've decided to structure this blog post as an interview of myself by myself, to get in the right mood. Here goes:

**Q:** I heard that you interviewed someone last Friday. Can you tell me some more about it?  
**A:** Sure, I'd love to! I interviewed *Amy Bisiewicz*, the Educational Technology Director of the Acton Boxborough School District. We met in the computer lab in room 129E.

**Q:** Why did you decide to choose Mrs. Bisiewicz?  
**A:** I knew that she would have more than enough to bring to the table on the subject of educational technology. She's one of the most qualified people in this district for sure!

**Q:** Cool. I'm sure you talked about quite a few things. What were some key ideas in the conversation?  
**A:** We started by getting a feel about what my senior project enables people to do. I described my vision, and we moved onto functionality and features.

**Q:** Could you repeat your vision for me?  
**A:** Sure - my vision is to create a device that can feasibly bring surface computing to the current education landscape.

**Q:** And what is surface computing exactly?  
**A:** In my case, I envision a projector that can project an interactive display onto a school desk. The interactivity comes with sensors that can detect a stylus and hands.

**Q:** What are some of the important features you discussed?  
**A:** Yeah! We realized that internet in the classroom is a big deal. Having a browser or access to the web in itself brings services such as Google Drive and Docs, Wikipedia, and WolframAlpha, to name a few. Also, an intuitive interface for taking notes, whether it be in the form of handwriting or a connected keyboard would really drive the product home. Some of the more whimsical ideas included a handwriting/graphics search or digitization, though they would definitely improve the product.

**Q:** Tell me some more about the special search you mentioned. I imagine it would be one of the more unique features of your device.  
**A:** Well, I had an idea when Mrs. Bisiewicz asked me about handwriting digitization. I thought how digitization allowed handwritten notes to be converted to text, which would make search faster. However, I imagined - what if a student could search for an item in their notes by rewriting the same thing in the search bar? That way, you could search for doodles and symbols that would otherwise be unsearchable.

**Q:** That sounds cool. What else did you discuss?  
**A:** We moved on to the topic of feasibility in the classroom. The device would have to be flexible to accommodate many different classroom layouts. It should be designed to enable activities and exercises that would be otherwise impossible with current computer hardware.

**Q:** Could you provide some examples of such activities?  
**A:** To start off, any activity that would involve rearranging desks in a circle or into groups would be infeasible with desktop computers. The tangle of wires that would ensue would be horrendous! Even in terms of group work, such a projection technology would allow seamless collaboration and sharing of information between learners. Imagine how hard it is to pass a paper to someone next to you using a laptop! And plus, a computer monitor is a wall that blocks the learner from visually engaging with the teacher.

**Q:** This sounds like what I'd want in my classroom. Exactly how feasible is it?  
**A:** It depends on two major factors: Ease of use and cost. In terms of ease of use, Mrs. Bisiewicz added that it also needs to be easily supported from the IT department side. For cost, I'm aiming to make the price as low as possible by utilizing as many existing technologies and infrastructures as I can.

**Q:** Can you tell me more about how you're thinking to pull this off?  
**A:** In addition to using existing technologies such as Wi-Fi and HTML5, I was originally thinking of using a low-cost optics system to project a smartphone screen. Mrs. Bisiewicz reminded me of the Raspberry Pi. Perhaps if the project gets far enough, I can ditch a smartphone in favor of a more integrated system like the Raspberry Pi. As such, I would be able to further customize it for the needs of such a product, perhaps using a stripped-down browser-based operating system. It's not going to be easy, and I may have bitten of more than I can chew, but I can at least dream big.

**Q:** Well, it was nice talking with you. You've got some nice ideas!
**A:** Thanks! The same goes for you.

As a result of this conversation with Mrs. Bisiewicz, I'll definitely look into using the Raspberry Pi as a longer term alternative to the rapid-prototype usage of a smartphone. Also, making the administration, maintenance, and support of a large fleet of devices a higher priority would definitely improve the feasibility of using a device in a real-world environment. There were other interesting tidbits that she mentioned. One of which was that the school's current Wi-Fi infrastructure is outdated, and in its current state is barely supporting just the teacher's devices. Also, another question would be how to apply restrictions while on the school network. As a whole, I'm quite comfortable with my Essential Question. At this point, I have yet to find any changes that I should make. This was certainly a useful experience in coming up with new ideas and getting a fresh new perspective on the matter!

And as always, a quote:
