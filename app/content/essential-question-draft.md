_"How can I make a mobile surface computing platform that could feasibly be used in a classroom environment?"_

I've brainstormed my essential question listed above. This question embodies my interests and is relevant to my life as a student. I would like to undertake this challenge because there is currently not a feasible solution to my knowledge - if there were such a feasible solution available, I would imagine that everyone would be using them in schools today. My essential question demonstrates the need for substantial research, as answering the question is quite an undertaking. It requires that I learn about optics and the math behind it, user experience and interaction design, industrial design and fabrication/construction techniques, and perhaps networking and machine vision algorithms. As the end product would be synthesized from various aspects ranging arcoss numerous fields in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math, and even Art, my EQ cannot be answered through secondary research alone. It requires me to apply existing and new knowledge to both hardware and software, along with original thinking for any aspect of design.

Breaking the EQ down, I've assembled a list of research questions approaching from different directions.

1. How can I choose parts/materials and build the product in such a way to reduce the cost as much as possible?
2. How can I make the product as intuitive and easy-to-use as possible, from both hardware and software fronts?
3. How much influence can such a technology have on the existing educational system?
  * Is this technology truly effective in improving student understanding of course material?
  * How can teachers make the best use of such a technology?
  * How far are school administrators willing to go in order to allow such a technology to be used in school?
  * How much will it cost for an entire school fully adopt the technology?

As a final product, my idea is to have a smartphone cradle with an optical sensor and a lens system which focuses the light from the screen onto the table. Such a system would be the culmination of all the research on hardware and software, optics and algoritms, and industrial design and interaction design.
