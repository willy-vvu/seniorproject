My camera doesn't have any mic inputs, so I'll need to figure that out as well. Perhaps I could use an app on my phone to record the mic, if I hacked together a connection?\n\nAnyways, here are some assorted shorter tips:\n- Keep the camera stable\n- Pay attention to lighting\n- Wear camera-friendly clothing\n- Organize your video files\n\n---",
